//! The `SyncSource` loop: the tick, the merge request and what a reviewer's answer means
//! (MF-27…MF-32).
//!
//! [`jcctl::sync::poll`] is the whole judgement — whether a run is due, whether the source
//! moved, what the import gates make of it, which lane it lands in and what the proposal is.
//! This module is the three things that judgement deliberately does not have: a clock, a socket
//! (through [`super::remote`]) and a write path into the forge (through [`super::proposal`]).
//!
//! Two rules shape everything below.
//!
//! **A run never writes to the branch the platform applies.** Every run ends as a merge request
//! on a branch named after the revision it carries, so a re-run after a failed forge call
//! continues on the branch it started instead of opening a second review (CC-18).
//!
//! **A reviewer's answer is what unblocks the next run.** While a proposal is open the loop
//! proposes nothing else for that source, and the answer decides what the source is then
//! observed at: merged means the repository carries that revision, closed means a person
//! refused it and the loop moves on rather than re-proposing it every minute.
