//! What an expired workspace leaves behind, and who takes it away (T-1260; CC-81, PF-83, CC-67).
//!
//! Expiry already hides a workspace: `live` answers `NotFound`, the listings skip it and the
//! gateway is no longer told about its preview. The branch is the part that does not go by
//! itself — and a branch nobody can reach through the Portal is a copy of the configuration
//! outliving the TTL that was set for it, which is the whole of what a TTL is for.
