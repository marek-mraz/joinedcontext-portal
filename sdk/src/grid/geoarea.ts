/**
 * The drawn area as an NGSI-LD geo query (UI-72, CIM 009 §4.10).
 *
 * A person draws a rectangle or a polygon on the grid's map and the grid asks the endpoint for the
 * entities inside it. That is four query parameters — `georel`, `geometry`, `coordinates`,
 * `geoproperty` — and never a typed geometry: the filter row cannot ask for a shape, which is why
 * `opsForKind` answers `[]` for a geo column.
 *
 * `coordinates` travels in the URL, so a shape a mouse drew freehand has to be made small enough to
 * send. Two steps, in this order, because the first is lossless at the precision the surface keeps:
 * the positions are rounded to 6 decimals (~0.1 m), and only if that is still too long are vertices
 * dropped, evenly, with `simplified` in the answer so the map can say the filter is not the shape.
