/**
 * UI-44, T-1610: a page with nothing in it says what lives there and what the first step is.
 *
 * Measured on main on 2026-09-19: of 22 empty states in the UI, three carried both a sentence and an
 * action and fifteen carried neither — a heading and an empty table teach nobody what the page is
 * for. This test reads the sources, so a page added later with a bare empty state fails here instead
 * of on dev, and it is the survey of T-1610 kept runnable.
 *
 * Four states are deliberately without a sentence, each for a reason named below: they are not empty
 * pages but filtered ones, where the first step is to clear the filter and a paragraph about the kind
 * would be in the way.
