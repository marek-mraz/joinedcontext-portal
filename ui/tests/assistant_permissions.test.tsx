/**
 * The assistant page refuses what the person's role does not permit (T-1584; UI-44, PF-50).
 *
 * Every other page's write controls go through `PermissionGuard`; the assistant page's did not.
 * A viewer of the project — no grant at all — was offered `Start`, `Continue` and the agent
 * profile's `Edit`, and met the refusal only as a 403 after pressing them, with nothing in the
 * page saying which verb on which kind they lack. The live walk over every page found it
 * (`ui/e2e/live/viewer-refused.spec.ts`), and the door was never the hole: `create_run` checks
 * `App`/`propose` and the profile block is proposed as the org's `AgentProfile`.
 *
 * Both states of the guard are asserted, because a guard that disabled the control for everyone
 * would pass a test that only looked at the viewer.
