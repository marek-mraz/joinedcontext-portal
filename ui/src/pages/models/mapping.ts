/**
 * What a Mapping means, without any of the pixels (T-0223, DM-33, DM-34, DM-38, DM-40).
 *
 * A Mapping is a LinkML-Map `TransformationSpecification` and nothing else: no JSONata, no jq,
 * no JavaScript (DM-33). This module holds the three things the editor needs to be more than a
 * text box — where the first guess at a derivation comes from, what the derivations do to one
 * example, and what the set of them costs to review — and it holds them as pure functions so
 * the meaning can be tested without rendering anything.
 *
 * The preview interpreter here is deliberately partial. It evaluates the invertible subset the
 * gateway can also run (`populated_from`, `value_mappings`, linear `unit_conversion`, `cast`)
 * and it evaluates nothing else. `expr` and `native` blocks come back named rather than
 * guessed at, because the authority on those is Bento running the compiled Bloblang in CI
 * (DM-35, DM-39), and a browser that quietly produced a different answer would be teaching the
 * author something untrue about their own mapping.
