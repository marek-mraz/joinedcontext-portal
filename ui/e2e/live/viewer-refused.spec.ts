/**
 * A viewer is refused with a reason on every page, on dev (T-1584; UI-44, PF-50).
 *
 * `ui/e2e/live/walk.spec.ts` proves a viewer's pages *open*, and asserts that no Edit or Delete is
 * offered — absence, not a refusal a person can read. `joinedcontext-conformance/e2e/journeys/16-role-permissions.spec.ts`
 * checks two controls on two pages. Server-side the whole matrix is proved
 * (`tests/roles_matrix_tests.rs::every_role_meets_every_route_and_operation_exactly_as_the_table_says`).
 * What was proved nowhere: that on **every** page of the navigation, every control a viewer may not
 * use carries the reason, and that the same calls made by hand answer 403.
 *
 * The rule this holds the UI to (`PermissionGuard`, UI-44): a control the person may not use stays
 * where it is, disabled, and says which verb on which kind their role lacks — by pointer, in the
 * wrapper's `title`, and by keyboard, in the element `aria-describedby` names. A control that is
 * simply absent is not a refusal: the person cannot tell it from a page that does not have it.
 *
 * The walk found one page whose write controls went through no guard at all — the assistant's
 * `Start`, `Continue` and the agent profile's `Edit`, disabled by an empty form and nothing else.
 * That is fixed in the same commit, with `tests/assistant_permissions.test.tsx` holding it.
 *
 * Nothing is written, so nothing is cleaned up: a viewer cannot write.
 *
 * One sign-in for both halves, on purpose: the walk over every page costs a few hundred requests
 * from one address, and the Portal's edge routes take 300 a minute per address (`limit-count`,
 * `components/portal/apisix-plugins.yaml`). A second OIDC login right behind the walk met a 429 and
 * failed the test for the edge's reason instead of the page's. The limit is doing its job; the
 * journey fits inside it.
