/**
 * Scenario 1 on dev (T-1264; AG-82, CC-76, CC-79): the assistant works inside a copy and stops at
 * the door a person owns.
 *
 * The employee journey beside this one (`copy-employee.spec.ts`) proves the copy itself. This one
 * proves who may end it: an assistant may open a copy, change it and show what it changes, and the
 * two ways out — proposing it as a Change and throwing it away — are a person's alone. Asked for
 * either, the assistant has to say so and leave the copy where it is; the tools behind those two
 * doors are not even offered to it, which `joinedcontext-conformance/tests/mcp/test_portal_mcp.py`
 * measures on the other door (T-1265).
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the project: the copy is discarded at the end, by the person whose browser
 * this is, and the journey asserts the project's pipeline is untouched throughout.
