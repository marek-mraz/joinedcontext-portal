/**
 * The assistant opens each create form, filled from one sentence, on dev (T-1597; AG-45, UI-45, AG-77).
 *
 * Two of the six creates were already driven by the assistant and proved:
 * roles in `change.spec.ts` and endpoints in
 * `joinedcontext-conformance/e2e/journeys/17-assistant-navigation.spec.ts`. The four here — a context
 * space, a data source, a pipeline and a dashboard — were driven by nobody: `load.spec.ts` and
 * `analyse.spec.ts` create a source and two pipelines through the *forms*, and `change.spec.ts` asks
 * the assistant for edits and a removal, never a create.
 *
 * What each case holds: one sentence in the dock lands on the kind's own page with its form open,
 * the form carries what the sentence said (the name at least, and whatever else the sentence named),
 * and the person's Propose opens a change whose plan still holds those values — nothing the assistant
 * wrote is lost between the dock, the form and the change.
 *
 * Every proposal is rejected again, so dev keeps what it had: this journey creates nothing. A
 * rejection is also the honest end, because a create the assistant drafted is exactly the change a
 * person is supposed to decide (PF-58).
 *
 * What the first run measured on dev (2026-09-19, portal 4f03b8c): only the dashboard case was
 * green. The other three had no create path in the dock at all — it reached for `jc_space_propose`
 * and filed a Change nobody had read, against AG-77 — which is T-2246; with that fix on dev
 * (portal c602705) all four are played here with nothing softened.
