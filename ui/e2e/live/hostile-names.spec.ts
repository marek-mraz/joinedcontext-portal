/**
 * Unicode, over-long and hostile names on a create form, on dev (T-1591; MF-13, UI-04, R20).
 *
 * `ui/e2e/live/forms-checklist.spec.ts` submits every form *empty* by design, so no browser test
 * ever typed a name that is not a well-formed one. Server-side the shape is covered by
 * `src/resource/mod.rs::dns1123_validation_rules` (ASCII, the 63/64 boundary) and hostile input is
 * covered at the gateway's query surface
 * (`joinedcontext-conformance/tests/schemathesis/test_gateway_endpoints.py::test_ts09_hostile_query_parameters_never_crash`).
 * What nobody had tried on dev is a person typing these names into the Portal.
 *
 * The properties, for each name: it is accepted or refused **by the rule** — 63 characters is a
 * name and 64 is not — the refusal is tied to the field and says the rule in words, the value is
 * shown as text and never as markup, and the form stays inside 400 px with the longest of them in
 * it. The same names are then sent at the door, where a refusal must be a 400 naming the field and
 * never a 500.
 *
 * Nothing is proposed: the only button pressed inside a form is Check. A check does save a draft,
 * so every draft these names left is deleted and the deletion is *checked* — a cleanup that fails
 * quietly is how residue reaches dev (T-2236).
