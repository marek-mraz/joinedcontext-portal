/**
 * What the role scheme allows and refuses, played on dev by the people it is about
 * (T-1585, T-1586, T-1587; CC-34, PF-50, PF-58, AG-11, UI-44).
 *
 * Each property is proved server-side by name already — `approve_self_approval_returns_403_and_makes_no_git_mutations`,
 * `an_administrator_of_the_kind_approves_their_own_change_and_the_merge_says_so`,
 * `a_binding_is_refused_when_its_role_names_a_verb_its_proposer_lacks_on_its_scope`,
 * `an_agent_never_approves_a_change_however_it_is_asked`. What no test proved until now is that a
 * person meets the rule where they work: in the page, in words, with the API agreeing.
 *
 * What dev's seeded people can express, and what they cannot: `demo.steward` is bound to both
 * `steward` and `org-admin` (`helsinki-rolebinding-admins.yaml`), so they administer every kind
 * and their own change is the *administrator exception*, not the refusal. `demo.approver` holds
 * `approve` alone and cannot propose, so nobody on dev can propose a change they may not then
 * approve. The plain self-approval refusal therefore stays where it is proved — in
 * `tests/changes_tests.rs` — until a fourth demo person holds `propose` without `delete`
 * (T-2231). This file plays the exception, the missing-role refusal and the grant refusal.
 *
 * Nothing is left on dev: every proposal opened here is rejected or its resource removed again.
