/**
 * Two hands on one resource, on dev (T-1588; CC-19, CC-34, PF-42).
 *
 * `tests/resource_mutate_tests.rs::a_second_proposal_while_a_change_is_open_names_it_and_writes_nothing`
 * proves the rule against a stub: the second proposal is a 409 naming the open change. What no test
 * proved is that a person meets it — that the second attempt says *which* change is in the way, that
 * the page offers it rather than swallowing it, and that deciding the first one lets the second
 * through.
 *
 * **One person plays both hands, and this is why.** Dev seeds three people and only
 * `demo.steward@hel.fi` holds `propose`: `demo.approver` holds `approve` alone and `demo.viewer`
 * holds neither (`helsinki-role-*.yaml`). A genuine collision between two proposers needs a fourth
 * person (T-2231). The rule under test does not care who the second hand belongs to — the resource
 * takes one open change, whoever opens it — so the refusal is played by the same session twice, and
 * the two-people case is named in T-2231 rather than pretended here.
